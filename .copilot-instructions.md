# Copilot Instructions - PetBoarding Project

## Project Structure

This workspace contains two main projects:

- **Backend**: .NET API project in `Core_PetBoarding_Backend/`
  PetBoarding_Api contains the .NET API project.
  PetBording_Domain contains the domain logic.
  PetBording_Application contains the application logic.
  PetBording_Infrastructure contains the infrastructure logic.
  PetBordading_Infrastructure contains the infrastructure logic.
- **Frontend**: Angular 19 application in `ng_PetBoarding_app/`

### File Structure

- Components in feature folders if scope is strictly related to a feature, otherwise in shared/components
- Services in feature/services if scope is strictly related to a feature, otherwise in shared/services
- Models in feature/models if scope is strictly related to a feature, otherwise in shared/models
- Guards in shared/guards

## General Guidelines
